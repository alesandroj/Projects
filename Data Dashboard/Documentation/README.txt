For this Capstone Project to fully function, a Figma subscription may be needed to run the file or by using the embedded html code in the executable folder.

To open the file, simply import the project file at the Figma project dashboard.

After opening the file, click the present button in the top right of the screen and the project is now available to use.

Clicking a country on the world map, the country's name on the horizontal bar graphs, or the bar on the graph itself will drill down the data to the specific country selected.

To return to the main page after a drill down, simply click the return button or navigate to another page with the three navigation buttons on top.
